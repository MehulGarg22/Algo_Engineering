## Guideline to Get Started
1. On the [GitHub page for this repository](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines), click on the Button "Fork".

   ![fork image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

2. Clone _your forked repository_ to your computer:

   ![code ui](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/code-button.png)

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/Algo_Engineering.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**
3. Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:<your-github-username>/Algo_Engineering.git
    git pull upstream master
    ```
6. Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add good commit message"
    ```
    echo "# MehulGarg_Website" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M master
    git remote add origin git@github.com:MehulGarg22/MehulGarg_Website.git
    git push -u origin master

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

7. Push your changes _to your repository_:

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```
    git push --set-upstream git@github.com:MehulGarg22/MehulGargWebsite.git master

    OR

    git remote add origin git@github.com:MehulGarg22/MehulGarg_Website.git
    git branch -M master.
    git push -u origin master.

8. Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and make a pull request:

    ![pull request image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)

    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
